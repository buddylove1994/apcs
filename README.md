Github will be used pretty extensively for things like code distribution, collaboration, one-v-one revisions, and anything else involving coding. The biggest feature here is the ability to make **forks** of each others' repositories and perform **pull requests**. In essense, we'll be able to fork code, make changes to improve the code, and push those changes back into the original repository and have them automatically highlighted by Github.
