We'll be using Github pretty extensively for things like code distribution, collaboration, one-v-one revisions, and anything else involving coding files. The biggest feature here is the ability to make **forks** of each others' repositories (i.e. folders) and perform **pull requests**. In essense, we'll be able to fork code from a repository, make changes in our copies to improve the code, and push those changes back into the original repository and have them automatically highlighted by Github.

I **strongly** encourage you each to create an account. It's not required or anything, but in doing so, you'll be able to work on the code we'll be uploading to this repository and it makes keeping track of everyone's things *so* much easier. You guys will also be able to help each other with your codes avaliable at all times. Once you've made an account, go ahead and fork and edit the *emails.md* file (then submit a pull request on the right).
